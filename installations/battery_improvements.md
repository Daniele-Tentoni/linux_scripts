## Power Profiles
With the system76-power package there are **Power Profiles** that can be accessed in the **System Menu** in the top-right corner of the screen. Those are:
1. High Performance: provide better performance over battery life;
2. Balanced: provide balanced performance and battery life;
3. Battery Life: provide more battery life over system performance.

I always use Balanced or Battery Life, I never really have to use the High Performance option.

To be continued...
